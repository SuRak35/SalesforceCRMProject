## A CRM Application to Manage the Services offered by an Institution:
EduConsultPro Institute is a leading educational institution offering a variety of courses and programs in diverse fields. With a growing number of prospective students seeking admission each year, the institute faces challenges in managing the admission process, students enquiry, and expert consulting services efficiently.
